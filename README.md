# Handwritten Digit Recognition 🖊️➡️🔢

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using a Neural Network.  
The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset** which contains 60,000 training and 10,000 testing grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9).  

The goal of the project is to classify input digit images into their respective classes with high accuracy.
